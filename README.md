## How The Game Works

In this game you have a Player and Enemies (bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies.

  * The player can move left, right, up and down
  * The enemies move at varying speeds on the paved block portion of the game board
  * Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the starting square
  * Once the player reaches the water (i.e., the top of the game board), the game is won
